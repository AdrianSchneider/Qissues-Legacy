# Working with Qissues

# Creating and Editing Issues

You can run `qissues create` to post a new issue. Similiarly, `qissues edit x` to edit an issue. Qissues will take your input and fire it in the tubes.

## Input Strategies

You can specify an alternate input strategy with `--strategy=x`, or by configuring `console.input.default_strateg` in your `.qissues`.

### File Editor ('edit')
By default, Qissues will launch a text editor ($EDITOR) and prepopulate it with a frontmatter YAML file. The format is as follows:

    ---
    title:
    other_field:
    another_field:
    ---

The portion between the ---s is YML, and you are meant to specify the issue body below. Example:

    ---
    title: The Internet is DOWN!
    assignee: AdrianSchneider
    labels: emergency, lol
    ---
    The internet is currently down. I cannot post TPS reports.

The system is abstracted enough that you an swap in another flie format with relative ease. More on that in customization doc.

To override the editor, you can change `console.editor`.

### Interactive ('interactive')
You can also answer questions interactively. However, it's a little harder to go back and make changes.

### CLI Options ('options') (PLANNED)
You can also create content non-interactively by specifying all of the fields as `-dfieldname=x`.
