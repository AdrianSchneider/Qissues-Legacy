# Managing Issues

## Changing Statuses

Status changes are applied by using the `move` command. Most trackers use the basic workflow, allowing you to apply status changes however you like.

However, for more complex systems (currently JIRA), Qissues will conform to the defined project workflows. Upon moving an issue, it will prompt you, if necessary, for any required fields. Similar to creating an issue, you can use alternate input strategies if desired, or it will default to editing a YAML file.

Currently, we will only prompt for required fields, but later we may show all of them, marking them as optional.

Examples:

    # Mark as In Progress
    qissues move 99 progress

    # Mark as Resolved (will prompt for Resolution)
    qissues move 99 resolved

Basic issue trackers won't prompt for additional information, and will never block illegal status changes.

## Changing Assignees

All of the trackers support assigning issues to users.

    qissues assign 99 username

There is also a shorthand to assign the issue to yourself:

    qissues assign 99 --me

## Commenting

All management commands also accept an option comment. You can specify one with `-m "your message"`, or you can specify an alterate option strategy instead:

    echo "This is my comment" | qissues assign 99 adrian --comment-strategy=stdin
